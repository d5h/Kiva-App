## Requirements from Kiva

### We need an app to...

Create some form of application that allows a Lender to determine the impact that their loans are having by combining these sources. A Kiva client like HP would love to know where and how the many thousands of loans they are making are creating an impact in the world. And this might also allow lenders to target an area or areas not typically getting under represented on the Kiva site.

### App Audience

- Lenders

### App Main Functions

(In order of priority.)

- [ ] A way for the lender to see where their money is going
- [ ] A way for lenders to see the broad impact of their loan, and loans similar to theirs
- [ ] A way for lenders to decide which borrow or sectors to finance

### Why this app will make a meaningful impact for us

From the Kiva API, you can determine where our borrowers reside in the world, on a loan by loan basis. You can also determine from many public sources, where there is need in the world, be it poverty, famine, lack of water, etc. This app allows individual lenders to see the impact they are making and possibly target areas that typically donâ€™t get as much support.
